            <p>
              If you had to imagine the perfect plate of food, delivered to you
              from anywhere in the world in mere seconds, what would it be?
              Would you fixate on the taste? Would plating come to mind? Or
              would you crave a piper platter of nostalgia and comfort?<br /><br />

              Here’s another exercise. Think back to your last plated meal. How
              long did it take for you to plate your food? If you’re anything
              like me, it probably took seconds if not quicker.
              <br /><br />

              Most daily habits associated with meals, like setting the table or
              arranging food on a plate, are instinctual and practical. Most
              people hate the idea of wasting energy a seemingly trivial task.
              Because, who notices if a dumpling sits at a 45 degree angle 5
              centimeters from the plate’s center? Lest we ignore the food
              influencers, the answer is practically no one.<br /><br />

              If you look outside the home, plating is a highly desired virtue
              of any great meal. Just look at restaurants, culinary schools and
              traditional dinner parties. Chefs devote months to perfecting a
              seasonal menu with presentations inspired by art, nature, and
              tradition. Culinary students spend weeks training their eyes on
              recognizing aesthetics in plating traditions from around the
              globe. Online food photography, a more accessible genre, offers
              another model for plating delectable meals.
              <br /><br />

              It almost seems reductive to say "You know good plating when you
              see it" or "it's a skill you're born with." But that is impossible
              — people must learn the rules for plating from someone, or
              somewhere. One answer lies in oral traditions: plating traditions
              are passed down from teacher to student and from elder to younger
              generation. With enough repetition, students adopt these plating
              traditions and make these practices their own. Moreover, ideas of
              beautiful food photography can come from the visually rich and
              natural environment, television shows and the internet including
              blogs, advertisements, and Instagram. With all these competing
              examples, does the perfect plate of food lie beyond our grasp?<br /><br />

              The easy thing would be to accept the facts and call it a day. But
              after researching plating for hours, I noticed certain themes
              could be codified. And with any data collection problem, the idea
              of trying the process, with technology came to mind. Could a
              computer, trained only on rules for beautiful and traditional
              platings and a hand picked dataset, pleasingly arrange food?
              <br /><br />

              Actually, it can! Here's a plate of food being arranged by a
              computer: <br />
              <br />

              <!-- INSERT ! -->

              The quality of the final plate, though, depends on the quality of
              the input. The more images, the better the computer can comprehend
              the skill of plating. And the more measurements, the more accurate
              the final food placement. Hours of research and hundreds of lines
              of code later, this comprehensive primer on food plating brings us
              one step closer to formalizing the definition of an “aesthetically
              pleasing plate of food.”<br /><br />

              My thesis research is three fold. First, I cover the history of
              plating, starting from its earliest traditions and rituals to its
              modern adoption into the history of food photography and
              restaurants. Then, I stitch together interviews with chefs,
              culinary instructors and stylists to showcase present day
              attitudes towards plating. Finally, I propose and implement two
              methods to achieve balanced and aesthetically pleasing plates of
              food.

              the statistics and folklore and mythology departments at harvard
              university. the original thesis is around 60 pages, but to be
              honest, i prefer this abbreviated version. because, at the end of
              the day, don't we all eat with our eyes?<br /><br />

            <h4>origins</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To date, the world's oldest bowl was found in China’s Hunan
                province in 2009 by Israeli researchers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bowls predate plates by several thousands of years. The lack of
                flatware suggests that people ate from bowls, other receptacles,
                or with their hands.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the early European medieval period, the standard food vessel
                was known as a trencher and made from metal or for the poor,
                thick stale pieces of wood or bread.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the late 16th century, metal trenchers were replaced by
                pewterware, earthenware and finally porcelain, which closely
                resembles the rimmed white plates used today.
              </li>
              <li>
                One of the earliest portioned plates, referred to as a divided
                serving dish, can be traced to Iran, Nishapur in the 10th
                century.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h4>traditions</h4>
            <p>
              Materials for eating vessels don't stray too far from home. Shaped
              by the natural landscape and historic traditions, people craft
              plates to reflect their space. Here are a few:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>seashells in norway</li>
              <li>banana leaves for filipino feast kamayan</li>
              <li>pineapples for bowls in jamaican cuisine</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Or assembled without plates</p>
            <ul>
              <li>injera, fermented teff flour, in eritrean food</li>
              <li>khobez flatbread to scoop hummus</li>
              <li>fufu to soak up stews in west africa</li>
              <li>tortillas substitute for plates in mexico</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h4>plating in art</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Ancient Egyptian tombs
                <a
                  href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ancient-egyptian-recipes"
                  >carried</a
                >
                visual recipes in them. One of the earliest recipe paintings
                from the 15th century BC showed workers forming cone shaped
                pastries out of tiger nuts.
              </li>
              <li>
                Closeby in Ancient Rome, artists decorated their walls and
                floors with mosaics dedicated to food. Depicting fish bones and
                scattered nuts, Asàrotos ikos or “unswept floor” mosaics were
                constructed to look like the aftermath of a banquet.
              </li>
              <li>
                After a dry spell of food artwork, due to its association with
                hedonistic pleasures, the Renaissance revitalized this genre. In
                1596, Carravaggio painted a simple basket of fruit. Little did
                he know this would set off an entire movement to capture the
                delicate beauty of food.
              </li>
              <li>
                In 1822, Nicéphore Niépce captured what may just be the first
                photographed dining table. Then in 1845, William Henry Fox
                Talbot took a photograph of a basket of peaches and a pineapple.
                The massive influence of still life paintings are felt strongly.

            <h4>innovation</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Everyone is a food plating expert these days. On Instagram,
                TikTok and other social media, food becomes a dominant, pulsing
                force that can be sculpted at will.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are even cult followings. Popular Instagram account The
                Art of Plating (<a href="www.instagram.com/theartofplating"
                  >@theartofplating</a

                around the globe. According to their website, they commit “to

              So how does statistics figure into plating? The easiest way to see
              the connection is to break down the problem of plating, the
              anatomy of a perfect plate, into quantifiable chunks. Click

                >Let us imagine a plate of dumplings at a dinner table. We've
                tossed a handful of dumplings randomly onto a plate, like darts
                on a bullseye. The presentation is unremarkable, but we can only
                switch the arrangement once. Any normal person might spend a few
                minutes rearranging the dumplings to perfection. <br /><br />

                But there's a faster way. Turns out, a computer measure and
                modify the arrangement into a well-balanced and aesthetically
                pleasing plate. It will only take a few seconds.<br /><br />

                This is a prime example of an optimization problem. An
                optimization problem begins when we want to find a *better*
                result and asking ourselves a few questions. What is the most
                desirable result? What is the starting point? And how much time,
                or computing power, do I have? <br /><br />

                Usually, you'll find people crunching numbers in fields like
                biomedicine, finance and technology. But optimization problems
                are everywhere and you can apply similar solutions to any
                industry (and yes, cooking and plating especially). <br /><br />

                To solve an optimization problem, we select the best result from
                a set of alternatives based on some criteria. In the case of
                plating, we must maximize a cost function related to pleasing
                food arrangements. The cost function, which evaluates how well
                our algorithm works with the data, includes several criteria.
                <br /><br />

                Here's one: We do not want the dumplings to overlap or stick
                together. To prevent this, we create a criteria to ensure that
                the dumplings are evenly spaced out. Take every combination of
                dumplings on the plate, then find the distance between the two,
                and add it to the criteria. In order to calculate this we need
                specific measurements. <br /><br />

                <span class="formula"
                  >Let Cd be the sum of distances between all combinations of
                  dumpling objects, n be the number of dumplings, D (d0, 0) be
                  the coordinates for the first dumpling with radius r0, and
                  (d1, 1) be the coordinates for the second dumpling with radius
                  r1.</span
                >

                <img class="pu-photo" src="img/math0.png" /><br /><br />

                Once we solve this criteria, another one comes to mind. Even if
                the dumplings are evenly spaced out, the dumplings could fall
                off the edge of the plate. To address this spatial problem, we
                include author-defined weights in the cost function. If the
                dumpling is in danger of falling off the plate, an “if”
                statement ensures that the algorithm will terminate.
                <br /><br />

                <span class="formula"
                  >Let D be the cost for the dumpling’s distance from the edge
                  of the plate, R be the radius of the plate, n be the number of
                  dumplings on the plate, r be the radii of the dumpling, and m
                  be the magnitude of the position in the polar coordinate
                  plane. To capture the distance from the edge of the plate for
                  all dumplings, we sum their individual values n times.</span
                ><br /><br />

                <img class="pu-photo" src="img/math1.png" /><br /><br />

                Given the above criteria, we can define the overall cost
                function below. The w coefficients define the relative weighting
                between the cost terms. If the cost function failed to include
                specified criteria, such as omitting certain wcoefficients, we
                would run into negative plating examples as seen below.

                <img class="pu-photo" src="img/math2.png" /><br /><br />

                If the system attempted to maximize the distance between
                dumplings, but not maximize the distance of dumplings from the
                edge of the plate, the dumplings would move off the plate (wa =
                0). On the other hand, if the system attempted to maximize the
                distance of the dumplings from the edge of the plate, but not
                the distances from one another, the dumplings would not move (wd
                = 0).
                <br /><br />

                To actually obtain a plating arrangement, we look to an
                algorithm called simulated annealing. This is an iterative local
                search optimization algorithm that uses Markov chain Monte
                Carlo.
                <br /><br />
                Why this one? This method is preferable when the possibilities
                are near infinite. When cycling through possibilities for
                plating arrangements, it won't settle for best first it finds --
                it'll keep searching, ie: an iteration can escape or overshoot
                the local minimum to explore more options. On the other hand,
                simulated annealing takes a long time to run and involves more
                complexity than an optimization algorithm such as gradient
                descent.</span
