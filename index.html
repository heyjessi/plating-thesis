            <p>
              If you had to imagine the perfect plate of food, delivered to you
              from anywhere in the world in mere seconds, what would it be?
              Would you fixate on the taste? Would plating come to mind? Or
              would your mind crave a piper platter of nostalgia and comfort?<br /><br />

              Here’s another exercise. Think back to your last plated meal. How
              long did it take for you to plate your food? If you’re anything
              like me, it probably took seconds to plate if not quicker.
              <br /><br />

              Most daily habits associated with meals, like setting the table or
              arranging food on a plate, are instinctual and practical. Most
              people abhor the idea of wasting intellectual energy a seemingly
              trivial task. Because, who notices if a dumpling sits at a 45
              degree angle 5 centimeters from the plate’s center? Lest we ignore
              the food influencers, the answer is practically no one.<br /><br />

              But if you look outside the home, plating is a highly desirable
              virtue of any great meal. Just look at restaurants, culinary
              schools and traditional dinner parties. Chefs devote months to
              perfecting a seasonal menu with presentations inspired by art,
              nature, and tradition. Culinary students spend weeks training
              their eyes on recognizing aesthetics in plating traditions from
              around the globe. Online food photography, a more accessible genre
              nowadays, offers another model to plate delectable meals.
              <br /><br />

              It almost seems reductive to say "You know good plating when you
              see it" or "it's a skill you're born with." But that is impossible
              — people must learn the rules for plating from someone, or
              somewhere. One answer lies in oral traditions: plating traditions
              are passed down from teacher to student and from elder to younger
              generation. With enough repetition, students adopt these plating
              traditions and make these practices their own. Moreover, ideas of
              beautiful food photography can come from the visually rich and
              natural environment, television shows and the internet including
              blogs, advertisements, and Instagram. With all these competing
              sources for food plating, is it true that the perfect plate of
              food lies beyond our grasp?<br /><br />

              The easy thing would be to accept the facts and call it a day. But
              after researching this topic for hours, I noticed certain themes
              about plating that could be codified. Conflicting advice be damned
              -- could a computer, trained only on rules for beautiful and
              traditional platings and a hand picked dataset, pleasingly arrange
              food? <br /><br />

              Actually, it can! The quality, on the other hand, depends on the
              quality of the input. The more images, the better the computer can
              comprehend plating. And the more measurements, the more accurate
              the final food placement. Hours of research and hundreds of lines
              of code later, this comprehensive primer on food plating brings us
              one step closer to formalizing the definition of an “aesthetically
              pleasing plate of food.” So if humans can learn and internalize
              rules, surely a computer can follow a similar procedure, or at the
              very least try to.<br /><br />

              My thesis research is three fold. First, I cover the history of
              plating, starting from its earliest traditions and rituals to its
              modern adoption into the history of food photography and
              restaurants. Then, I stitch together interviews with chefs,
              culinary instructors and stylists to showcase present day
              attitudes towards plating. Finally, I propose and implement two
              methods to achieve balanced and aesthetically pleasing plates of
              food.
