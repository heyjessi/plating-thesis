            <p>
              If you had to imagine the perfect plate of food, delivered to you
              from anywhere in the world, what would it be? Would you fixate on
              the taste? Would plating come to mind? Or would you crave a piping
              platter of nostalgia and comfort?<br /><br />

              Of course, many elements make a perfect plate of food. But one
              thing's certain: we constantly eat with our eyes. "The camera eats
              first." Advertisements. The art of plating. Instagram and TikTok.
              Aesthetic elements of food surround, smother and intrigue us. And
              whether we openly acknowledge them or not, they impact our
              relationship with eating.<br /><br />

              <!-- Think back to your last plated meal. Did you plate it
              intentionally? How long did it take for you to plate your food? If
              you’re anything like me, it probably took seconds if not quicker.
              <br /><br /> -->

              Outside the home, plating is a highly desired virtue of any great
              meal. Just look at restaurants, culinary schools and traditional
              dinner parties. Chefs devote months to perfecting a seasonal menu
              with presentations inspired by art, nature, and tradition.
              Tweezers are commonly used to meticulously plate items. Culinary
              students spend weeks training their eyes on recognizing aesthetics
              in plating traditions from around the globe. Online food
              photography, a more accessible genre, offers another model for
              plating delectable meals.
              <br /><br />

              Much training and preparation goes into plating. So it seems
              reductive to say "You know good plating when you see it" or "it's
              a skill you're born with." And people must learn the rules for
              plating from someone, or somewhere. <br /><br />

              One answer lies in oral traditions: plating traditions are passed
              down from teacher to student and from an elder to younger
              generation. With enough repetition, students adopt these plating
              traditions and make these practices their own. <br /><br />

              Additionally, inspiration for beautiful food plating can come from
              the visually rich and natural environment, television shows and
              the internet. With all these diverse yet competing examples, does
              the perfect plate of food lie within our grasp?<br /><br />

              The easy thing would be to accept the highly subjective nature of
              plating. But after crawling through hundreds of different plates,
              I noticed certain themes could be codified, turned into numerical
              data points. With any data collection problem, the idea of
              digitizing the process became an intriguing puzzle I wanted to
              explore further. Could a computer, trained only on rules for
              beautiful and traditional platings and a hand picked dataset,
              pleasingly arrange food?
              <br /><br />

              According to my research, it is possible! Here's a plate of food
              being arranged using a computer program: <br />
              <br />

              <iframe
                src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CDA5CHZftL3ZA5dB4hRotKA5ei90nrmW/preview"
                width="320"
                height="240"
                allow="autoplay"
                class="video"
              ></iframe
              ><br /><br />

              There are certainly limitations to this model. I chose a circular
              plate and used round dumplings to optimize for symmetry. I named
              the number of dumplings to plate. These are all deliberate
              decisions but it is a start. Hours of research and hundreds of
              lines of code later, this primer on food plating brings us one
              step closer to formalizing the definition of an “aesthetically
              pleasing plate of food.”<br /><br />

              My thesis research is three fold. First, I cover the history of
              plating, starting from its earliest traditions and rituals to
              modern adoptions in food photography and restaurants. Then, I
              stitch together interviews with chefs, culinary instructors and
              stylists to showcase present day attitudes towards plating. You
              can find their quotes on this website. Finally, I propose and
              implement two statistical methods to achieve balanced and
              aesthetically pleasing plates of food.

            <h4>origins</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To date, the world's oldest bowl was found in China’s Hunan
                province in 2009 by Israeli researchers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bowls predate plates by several thousands of years. The lack of
                flatware suggests that people ate from bowls, other receptacles,
                or with their hands.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the early European medieval period, the standard food vessel
                was known as a trencher and made from metal or for the poor,
                thick stale pieces of wood or bread.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the late 16th century, metal trenchers were replaced by
                pewterware, earthenware and finally porcelain, which closely
                resembles the rimmed white plates used today.
              </li>
              <li>
                One of the earliest portioned plates, referred to as a divided
                serving dish, can be traced to Iran, Nishapur in the 10th
                century.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h4>traditions</h4>
            <p>
              Materials used to make eating vessels don't stray too far from
              home. Shaped by the natural landscape and historic traditions,
              people craft plates to reflect their space. Here are a few:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>seashells in norway</li>
              <li>banana leaves for filipino feast kamayan</li>
              <li>pineapples for bowls in jamaican cuisine</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Or assembled without plates</p>
            <ul>
              <li>injera, fermented teff flour, in eritrean food</li>
              <li>khobez flatbread to scoop hummus</li>
              <li>fufu to soak up stews in west africa</li>
              <li>tortillas substitute for plates in mexico</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h4>plating in art</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Ancient Egyptian tombs
                <a
                  href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ancient-egyptian-recipes"

                >
                visual recipes in them. One of the earliest recipe paintings
                from the 15th century BC showed workers forming cone shaped
                pastries out of tiger nuts.
              </li>
              <li>
                Closeby in Ancient Rome, artists decorated their walls and
                floors with mosaics dedicated to food. Depicting fish bones and
                scattered nuts, Asàrotos ikos or “unswept floor” mosaics were
                constructed to look like the aftermath of a banquet.
              </li>
              <li>
                After a dry spell of food artwork, due to its association with
                hedonistic pleasures, the Renaissance revitalized this genre. In
                1596, Carravaggio painted a simple basket of fruit. Little did
                he know this would set off an entire movement to capture the
                delicate beauty of food.
              </li>
              <li>
                In 1822, Nicéphore Niépce captured what may just be the first
                photographed dining table. Then in 1845, William Henry Fox
                Talbot took a photograph of a basket of peaches and a pineapple.
                The massive influence of still life paintings are felt strongly.

            <h4>innovation</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In the 20th century, photographers became fed up with still life
                photographs reminiscent of age-old paintings techniques.
              </li>
              <li>
                In 1927, Edward Steichen projected a cross-hatched shadow onto a
                wall by experimenting with neatly arranged sugar cubes. Nearly
                twenty years later, Irving Penn arranged frozen blocks of
                raspberries, carrots, and corn into a colorful cover for Vogue.

                Cookbooks were usually littered with text, but 1930s cookbooks
                incorporated more visual elements including illustrations and
                technicolor photography.

              <li>
                In the 1990s, food photography further divorced itself from its
                painting roots and sought to capture food’s bright and natural
                qualities for a commercial audience. Food magazines in the late
                1900s and early 2000s — Bon Appétit, Gourmet, and Elle — hired
                still photographers to create realistic and vibrant food scenes
                and curated a list of stylists specializing in food.
              </li>
              <li>
                In food stylist Victoria Granof’s perspective, food
                photography’s radical shift happened during the early 2000s. At
                that point, food photography had not yet reached the masses.
                Blogs were slowly popping up and phone cameras were in their
                nascent stages. Recalling a Father’s Day food assignment for Bon
                Appétit, Granof was surprised that prop stylists were given more

                says. “And the prop stylist came in and had boxes with neck ties
                and clocks and books.” Food was not the star, but merely a prop
                to insert next to other props.

                Everyone is a food plating expert these days. On Instagram,
                TikTok and other social media, food becomes a dominant, pulsing
                force that can be sculpted at will.

            <p>
              So how does statistics figure into plating? To see the connection,
              we must first break down plating, and the anatomy of a perfect
              plate, into quantifiable chunks. <br /><br />

              <span id="wordy-stats"
                >Let us imagine a plate of dumplings at a dinner table. We've
                tossed a handful of dumplings randomly onto a plate, like darts
                on a bullseye. The presentation is unremarkable, but we can only
                switch the arrangement once. A logical person might spend a few
                minutes mapping out the ideal plate before rearranging the
                dumplings once. <br /><br />

                But there's a faster way. Turns out, a computer measure and
                modify the arrangement into a well-balanced and aesthetically
                pleasing plate. And it will only take a few seconds.<br /><br />

                This is an example of an optimization problem. An optimization
                problem begins when we want to find a *better* result and asking
                ourselves a few questions. What is the most desirable result?
                What is the starting point? And how much time, or computing
                power, do I have? <br /><br />

                You'll find people crunching numbers in fields like biomedicine,
                finance and technology. But optimization problems are everywhere
                and you can apply similar solutions to any industry (yes,
                cooking and plating especially). <br /><br />

                To solve an optimization problem, we select the best result from
                a set of alternatives based on some criteria. In the case of
                plating, we create a bunch of different plating scenarios,
                measure certain characterics of the final plates, and elimate
                ones that don't fit the criteria. In more technical terms we
                must maximize a cost function related to pleasing food
                arrangements. The final plate is the solution to this
                optimization problem.
                <br /><br />

                The cost function, which evaluates how well our algorithm works
                with the given data, includes several criteria. Here's an
                example of one: We do not want dumplings to overlap or stick
                together on a plate. To prevent this, we create a general
                criteria to ensure that the dumplings are evenly spaced out. We
                compute every combination of dumplings arrangements on the
                plate, then find the distance between the two, which is then
                added to the criteria. The program will attempt to avoid
                situations where the criteria is large.
                <br /><br />

                <span class="formula"
                  >Let Cd be the sum of distances between all combinations of
                  dumpling objects, n be the number of dumplings, D (d0, 0) be
                  the coordinates for the first dumpling with radius r0, and
                  (d1, 1) be the coordinates for the second dumpling with radius
                  r1.</span
                >

                <img class="pu-photo" src="img/math0.png" /><br /><br />

                Even if the dumplings are evenly spaced out, the dumplings could
                fall off the edge of the plate. If the dumpling is in danger of
                falling off the plate, an “if” statement ensures that the
                algorithm will terminate.
                <br /><br />

                <span class="formula"
                  >Let D be the cost for the dumpling’s distance from the edge
                  of the plate, R be the radius of the plate, n be the number of
                  dumplings on the plate, r be the radii of the dumpling, and m
                  be the magnitude of the position in the polar coordinate
                  plane. To capture the distance from the edge of the plate for
                  all dumplings, we sum their individual values n times.</span
                ><br /><br />

                <img class="pu-photo" src="img/math1.png" /><br /><br />

                Given the above criteria, and a few more elements, we can define
                the overall cost function. The w coefficients help define how
                much importance we should assign to each term or criteria in the
                cost function. If the cost function failed to include an edge
                case or a particular criteria, we would run into negative
                plating examples as seen below.

                <img class="pu-photo" src="img/math2.png" /><br /><br />

                If the system attempted to maximize the distance between
                dumplings, but not maximize the distance of dumplings from the
                edge of the plate, the dumplings would move off the plate (wa =
                0). On the other hand, if the system attempted to maximize the
                distance of the dumplings from the edge of the plate, but not
                the distances from one another, the dumplings would not move (wd
                = 0).
                <br /><br />

                To obtain a plating arrangement, we look to an algorithm called
                simulated annealing. This is an iterative local search
                optimization algorithm that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo.
                <br /><br />
                Why this one? A run of the mill optimization algorithm may find
                an ideal plating arrangement that satisfies the cost function
                and immediately stop looking for more plating arrangements.
                Simulated annealing is different: When cycling through
                possibilities for plating arrangements, it won't settle for best
                first it finds -- it'll keep searching, ie: an iteration can
                escape or overshoot the local minimum to explore more options.
                On the other hand, simulated annealing takes longer to run and
                involves more complexity than gradient descent. <br />

                Here's a second way to imagine a computer generating ideas for
                plating food. I took nearly a hundred images of dumplings from
                the internet and measured the distances between dumplings and
                plate lengths. Then, I fed all this data into a python program
                to procedurally generate data points about the arrangement: the
                number of dumplings, the size of the plate, the appearance of
                soy sauce, the distances between dumplings, etc. And then it
                places the items on the plate rapidly so that it covers as many
                examples as possible. For reference, the number of dumplings
                based on a Binomial distribution and distance measurements use a
                Log Normal Distribution. <br />
