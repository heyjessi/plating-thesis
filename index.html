            <p>
              If you had to imagine the perfect plate of food, delivered to you
              from anywhere in the world in mere seconds, what would it be?
              Would you fixate on the taste or the plating? Or would your mind
              crave a piper platter of nostalgia and comfort?<br /><br />

              Here’s another exercise. Think back to your last plated meal. How
              long did it take for you to plate your food? If you’re anything
              like me, it probably took seconds to plate if not quicker.
              <br /><br />

              Most daily habits associated with meals, like setting the table or
              arranging food on a plate, are instinctual and practical. Most
              people abhor the idea of wasting intellectual energy a seemingly
              trivial task. Because, who notices if a dumpling sits at a 45
              degree angle 5 centimeters from the plate’s center? Lest we ignore
              the food influencers, the answer is practically no one.<br /><br />

              But if you look outside the home, plating is a highly desirable
              virtue of any great meal. Just look at restaurants, culinary
              schools and traditional dinner parties. Chefs devote months to
              perfecting a seasonal menu with presentations inspired by art,
              nature, and tradition. Culinary students spend weeks training
              their eyes on recognizing aesthetics in plating traditions from
              around the globe. Online food photography, a more accessible genre
              nowadays, offers another model to plate delectable meals.
              <br /><br />

              With regards to plating, it seems too simplistic to say "You know
              it when you see it," especially when based around a person’s
              highly subjective opinion. So truthfully, no one has come up with
              one formal definition for what is aesthetically acceptable to
              everyone.<br /><br />

              But after researching this topic for hours, I noticed certain
              themes that could be codified. In a world saturated with
              conflicting advice about food presentation, could a computer,
              trained only on rules for beautiful and traditional platings and
              this hand picked dataset, pleasingly arrange food? Hours of
              research and hundreds of lines of code later, this comprehensive
              primer on food plating brings us one step closer to formalizing
              the definition of an “aesthetically pleasing plate of food.”<br /><br />

              Food stylist Victoria Granof once said of food plating, “It's just
              something that you're born with.” But that is impossible — people
              must learn the rules for plating from someone, or somewhere. One
              answer lies in oral traditions: plating traditions are passed down
              from teacher to student and from elder to younger generation. With
              enough repetition, students adopt these plating traditions and
              make these practices their own.
              <br /><br />

              Ideas of beautiful food photography can also come from the
              visually rich and natural environment, television shows and the
              internet including blogs, advertisements, and Instagram. If humans
              can learn and internalize rules, surely a computer can follow a
              similar procedure, or at the very least try to.<br /><br />

              My thesis research is three fold. First, I cover the history of
              plating, starting from its earliest traditions and rituals to its
              modern adoption into the history of food photography and
              restaurants. Then, I use interviews with chefs, culinary
              instructors and stylists to create a comprehensive about present
              day attitudes towards plating. Finally, I proposed and implemented
              two methods to achieve balanced and aesthetically pleasing plates
              of food.

              i'm always down for a coding, design or food collaboration. as you
              can probably tell, i love meeting new people and cooking both
              elaborate and unfussy meals. bon appétit!
